Towards Real-Time Dynamic Facial Expression 
Recognition: Balancing Computational 
Efficiency and Accuracy
 Abstract: 
Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in human-computer 
interaction, social robotics, and affective computing. DFER captures temporal patterns of 
emotions, enabling systems to understand subtle changes in human affect over time. 
However, achieving both high accuracy and efficient real-time inference remains 
challenging, particularly for deployment on resource-constrained devices. 
Recent advances in deep learning (CNN-RNN, Vision Transformers (ViT), and multi-modal 
learning) show promising results. Yet, many state-of-the-art DFER methods are 
computationally heavy and not optimized for real-time applications. 
This topic aims to investigate lightweight, efficient DFER models that maintain high 
recognition accuracy while reducing computational cost, enabling practical use in real-time 
scenarios. 
Motivation: 
While the DFER field has advanced rapidly, many existing deep learning methods remain too 
heavy for real-time. so as I propose to balance between the Efficiency and Accuracy then 
may go with some approaches that we can able to investigate with it such as : 
1- Leverage Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA to fine-tune 
large Vision Transformer (ViT) models effectively with minimal overhead. 
2- Explore quantization techniques (FP16, INT8) to reduce model size and accelerate 
inference. 
Through this work, we contribute toward real-time capable, efficient DFER systems 
applicable in different domains with taking care about two main terms (Efficiency , Accuracy) 
To be able to achieve the goal the following benchmark dataset will be used for model 
development and evaluation: 
FERv39K: It is a static image dataset — it provides frames annotated with 7 expressions : - - 
The source is video segments 
The dataset as provided → already contains frames extracted from videos and 
labeled 
So this research will provide valuable insights into balancing computational efficiency and 
accuracy for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition. The outcome is expected to contribute 
practical solutions that advance real-time DFER applicability in modern intelligent systems.
